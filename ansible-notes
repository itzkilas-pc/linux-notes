Ansible
Ansible is an open-source automation tool for IT tasks, including configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.
•	Agentless: You don't need to install any agents on the managed nodes. It uses SSH for communication.
•	Playbooks: You write Ansible configurations in YAML, which is easy to read and write.
•	Modules: It includes a vast library of modules to perform various tasks.
•	Idempotent: Ensures that running the same playbook multiple times will result in the same state, avoiding repeated changes. In detail, this means that running a task multiple times will have the same effect as running it once. Basically, if a change is already applied, Ansible won't apply it again. This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of unintentional changes
-  Keywords when describing Ansible: user management, package management, service management

1.	To find and access ansible : cd /etc/ansible

To create a directory=file
ansible dmz -m file -a “path=/tmp/dmz-dir state=directory”

To create a file
ansible dmz -m file -a “path=/path/of/file state=touch”

Add a line inside a file in every group/server
ansible dmz -m lineinfile -a “path=/tmp/dmz-dir/test1 line=’addling line using ansible”
ansible dmz -m lineinfile -a “path=/tmp/dmz-dir/test1 line2=’addling a second line using ansible”
ansible as1 -m user -a 'name=kyle2 state=present password="$1$E96.c7nh$saUUG3Cj9zHiouAnig4Sx/"'
ansible dmz -m yum -a “name-httpd state=latest”

o	shell
o	service
o	selinux
o	firewalld
o	copy

state-
	present
	absent = deleted/removed
ansible dmz -m shell -a “shutdown now”

When adding a password and a new user:
First: make an  encrypted password
	openssl passwd -1
Then do the following(pay attention to the quotation marks):
ansible as1 -m user -a 'name=kyle2 state=present password="$1$E96.c7nh$saUUG3Cj9zHiouAnig4Sx/"'
